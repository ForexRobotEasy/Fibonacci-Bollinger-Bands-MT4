Fibonacci Bollinger Bands MT4

Forex Robot Easy - forexroboteasy.com

------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:

This code is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 4 that combines Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands to identify support and resistance levels in the forex market. The indicator calculates Fibonacci levels based on the specified number of levels and the selected moving average type and price data source. It then calculates Bollinger Bands using the Fibonacci levels and plots them on the chart.

The indicator also plots support and resistance levels based on the Fibonacci levels. The support levels are calculated by finding the Fibonacci levels below the current price, while the resistance levels are calculated by finding the Fibonacci levels above the current price. These support and resistance levels can be used to identify potential entry and exit points in the market.
